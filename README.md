# prompt-morph
Generate morph sequences with Stable Diffusion. Interpolate between two or more prompts and create an image at each step.

# Installation
Automatic Install:
1. Add this repository's url (https://github.com/feffy380/prompt-morph.git) to SD Web UI under Extensions -> Install from URL
2. Restart UI

Manual Install:
1. Copy `prompt_morph.py` into the `scripts` folder in [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
2. Add `moviepy==1.0.3` to `requirements_versions.txt` or install it manually

Enter at least two prompts in the text area in the script interface (one per line). If you use a negative prompt, it will apply to the whole sequence.
The script creates a `morphs` directory in your output directory and saves each sequence in its own folder here.  

# How does it work?
An explanation of multi-cond guidance from Birch-san can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xr7wwf/sequential_token_weighting_invented_by/iqdm5ya/) but in summary, multiple prompts are used to guide the sampling process. Each prompt has a weight, which allows us to animate a transition from A to B by going from 100% A and 0% B to 0% A and 100% B.
